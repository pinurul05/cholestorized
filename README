Cholesterolized
---------------

This is a sample cakephp project to demonstrate cholesterol 
plugin (http://github.com/rchavik/cholesterol).

- Tested cakephp 1.3 HEAD
- jQuery UI - http://ui.jquery.com
- jqgrid - http://www.trirand.com/blog/ (Tested with 3.5.3)

Installation
------------

1. Adjust value of CAKE_CORE_INCLUDE_PATH in APP/webroot/index.php to 
   your cakephp install

2. You might need to adjust APP/.htaccess and APP/webroot/.htaccess accordingly

3. Download, extract jquery and place it in APP/webroot
   Copy or symlink the 'js' directory to APP/webroot/js/jquery
   Copy or symlink the 'css/<themeName>' directory to APP/webroot/css/jquery


4. Download, extract jqGrid and place it in APP/webroot
   Copy or symlink the 'js' directory to APP/webroot/js/jqgrid
   Copy or symlink the 'css' directory to APP/webroot/css/jqgrid


5. If you use a different path for jquery or jqgrid, adjust the layout file:
   APP/views/layouts/default.ctp

6. Extract or clone cholesterol from github and place it in APP/plugins

7. Create demo schema and load sample data

      cake schema create
      cake sample_data load

8. Start testing.  If I don't screw up, you should be able to view two grids
   with different options applied.

Good luck and have fun,
